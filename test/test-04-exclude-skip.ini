# In this example, text is RECURSE and images is NORECURSE.  LogSkippedFiles is True.
# When LogSkippedFiles is set, the REVIEW will include a list of files in the SourceFolder
# that were skipped because of folder exclusion.
# Because "text" is recursive, all files in "text" and below will be skipped.
# Because "images" is NORECURSE, files in images are skipped but files in subfolfers are NEW.
