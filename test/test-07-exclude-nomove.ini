# This is the same as test-06, but DisableMover is True
# DisableMover is a feature that lookes for misplaced files on the target location.
# If a file that would be copied from the source is found on the target device, but
# in the wrong location, the file is moved from target to target instead of copied
# from source to target.  In this example, the feature is disabled.

# This is the control-section

Logfile = test\logs\Test-FileSync.log
# Identifies the command to run by name or id
Execute = run
